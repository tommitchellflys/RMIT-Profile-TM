                                My name is Thomas Mitchell, I am a 29yr old Australian currently living in Spain, A locksmith by trade, 
                                and a background in sales, I have spent the last 10 years jumping out of 
                                planes. Skydiving started as a hobby and quickly became my job. I have been lucky enough 
                                to travel the world over through skydiving. My father was an IT professional, so I 
                                have been exposed to the IT industry my whole life. I speak English and a little bit of Spanish. 
                                <hr color="black">
 
                                As I expressed earlier, IT has always been apart of my life! As a child I always had a computer 
                                thanks to my father, So I guess you could say he is my inspiration to be here now and looking to 
                                make this career change. IT became necessary as I progressed through my Skydiving career. Social media marketing, 
                                brand representation and upholding an internet presence as a whole became more prevalent and required, 
                                I thoroughly enjoy getting creative with both content creation and programming although 
                                I am still only a beginner.
                                <hr color="black">
 
                                I chose RMIT as my gateway into this new industry because RMIT offered what seemed to me 
                                to be the most complete opportunity with an all inclusive agenda and the ability to participate 
                                remotely. I look forward to continuing my studies with RMIT and hope to earn a Bachelors degree in IT.
 
                                During my time at RMIT I am hoping to gain a fundamental knowledge of the IT industry as a whole. 
                                I Plan on specialising in Programming as I believe it will “ scratch” my creative itch and also 
                                provide many great opportunities for years to come.

                                        <br/>

                                        I have attatched a link to a position with Microsoft as a software engineer. 
                                        What makes this position appealing to me is the ability to be working and creating 
                                        with an industry leadeing company such as Microsoft. I believe such a job would be full of 
                                        creative challenges and position me in the forefront of the industry. Allowing me 
                                        to gain key experience and insight into the future of the IT industry, whilst keeping my 
                                        skillset sharp and relative for years to come.<br/><br/>

                                        Requirements.<br/>
                                    	<br/>2+ years of experience with one or more general purpose programming languages 
                                           including but not limited to: Java, C/C++, C#, Python
                                    	<br/>Bachelors degree in Computer Science or related technical field experience.
                                        <br/>

                                            The required skills to secure this job along with experience with Amazon web services, 
                                            azure and cloud platforms are a elusive to me at this stage. As this is not a junior position
                                            I believe Microsoft would be looking for an engineer who has experience in working within such
                                            a cruicial organisation, A degree would be necessary also coupled with an impeccable interview process.  
                                            I look forward to the challenge when my day comes!<br/><br/>

                                        As of right now based on my current skillset, unfortunately I would not be a viable candidate. 
                                        Although I posses great people skills, a can do attitude a high level of sales and a basic level of python. 
                                        Its made clear in the add they are looking for someone a lot more qualified, I look forward to gaining a skillset 
                                        Im proud to deliver to a recruiter for a role similar to this in the future when I am ready.<br/><br/>

                                        I plan on participating in RMITs Bachelor of IT, Upon completion I am hopeful to gain 
                                        key industry experience via an internship or work with an interesting startup. The ability to c
                                        continue working on my python and Java and Javascript skillset throughout this process is a must.   
                                        Also gaining experience in cloud computing and azure is a must for me and my ambitions. 
                                        Once finished my degree I will continue to upskill via relevant outlets that are also

                                        The results of these tests shed light on what is clearly some of my strengths and weaknesses, it was an empowering experiment to get 
                                        some insight into such areas of my personality. Based on the results when participant in team exercises, I will endeavour to not be 
                                        too judgemental or over assertive/ overpower my peers with my overbearing personality. When forming a team, I would take this into 
                                        account by trying to include a variety of people with different personality types so we could all pick each other up where we are 
                                        lacking and come together to create a strong well rounded unit.<br/><br/>

                                        To find out that I am an auditory learner is not a surprise to me, in fact I already thought that without actually doing 
                                        the test. Having now done the test tough I look forward to leveraging this fact and ensuring I encorporate an auditory aspect to 
                                        all my study / work from here on out <br/><br/>
                                        
                                        I will continue to strive to be motivated , deal with complicated problems and be practical as I think they are all positive traits.<br/><br/>

                                     suffering from depression due to Covid.<br/><br/>

                                     Overview:
                                        The project will be a peer to peer chat style service provided, 
                                        via a dedicated website / smart phone application. It is designed to 
                                        help negate / battle the effects of the global pandemic.<br/><br/>


                                        Motivation:
                                        As we are all aware, Covid 19 has swept the world, people are isolated, losing their jobs, 
                                        homes, businesses, right to travel, access to their families often this is just the beginning. 
                                        In 2020 60,000+ Australians and countless other nations natives also were stranded overseas 
                                        without the ability to come home. I myself was one of these Australians, often stranded 
                                        nationals find themselves stranded in countries where the native tongue is not their own, 
                                        as one of these victims of the global pandemic I know firsthand how important it can be to 
                                        just have someone to talk too, someone who you can just be yourself too and gain a grip of your reality. 
                                        <br/><br/>

                                        Description:
                                        My project Idea is to build a smart phone app/web service where people can go – find a 
                                        like-minded person who is in a position to sacrifice a small bit of time to listening and 
                                        forming a relationship with people. The goal being simply people being there for other people. 
                                        In order to help combat the resulting depression / suicide coming from this pandemic. 
                                        The product would simply be a chat service. Upon registering for the app, 
                                        you would put in your name, age and nationality. The app would then match you up with a * Your Sis, 
                                        My Bro* advisor who suits your age and language requirements resulting in the user having someone to talk too. 
                                        After 3 successful “chats” the user would be prompted to undergo a quick training on the app to become a *Your sis, My bro* advisor. 

                                        Advisor training would be simple but effective. Although advisor training would only be 5 minutes it would 
                                        go over key insights on how to be an effective listener and also on how to identify a potentially harmful situation. 
                                        The app would include inbuilt functionality for contacting emergency services for the user’s current location 
                                        in the world and simple prompts in the case that the advisor could not communicate in the emergency services 
                                        language depending on the location of the user.

                                        Through sponsorship with airlines, supermarkets clothing stores, advisors would be able to redeem points 
                                        earned for each relationship / conversation and 5-star rating for real world helpful items / services to help 
                                        incentivise advisors and ensure a high-quality product is delivered.

                                        Skills required:

                                        Marketing professional
                                        The skills and resources to put together a project like this is definitely doable with outsourcing options
                                        such as fiverr , Upwork etc. I believe this project is completely doable and would be an extremely beneficial
                                        product once launched. The main problem I see for a project of this type is the lack of monetization. 
                                        This project would mainly be a passion project with limited possibilities for monetization, 
                                        possibly the website and application could generate revenue from add space if it as to take off.
                                        <br/><br/>

                                        Outcome:
                                        I believe that if this project was to come to reality it would have a real benefit for a lot of people world-wide. 
                                        It would easily be able to shift focus from Covid once the pandemic has come to an end and quickly shift focus onto 
                                        another area such men and women with mental health issue, troubled teens etc. all in all I think a free place to go 
                                        and chat when you need someone to talk to would be extremely welcomed and with the right level of community support 
                                        would be welcomed worldwide!
